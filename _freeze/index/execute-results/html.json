While public analyses on batting and pitching have advanced rapidly, defensive evaluation has been comparatively underdeveloped. The SAFE (Spatially Adjusted Fielding Evaluation) framework, introduced by @jensen_2009, was the first effort in the public sphere to evaluate defense as a continuous space. We revisit the SAFE framework using modern Statcast data with an emphasis on infield defense, a notable struggle for prior defensive metrics.

pitching in baseball has been at the forefront of sports analytics for decades, mostly due to their discrete nature and the availability of relevant, quantifiable data.\nIt is relatively simple to measure the outcome of a plate appearance or a pitch, making it easier to develop metrics that accurately reflect player performance in these areas.\nIn contrast, defensive evaluation in the public sphere has lagged behind due to the continuous, spatiotemporal nature of fielding. \n\nStill, Major League Baseball (MLB) organizations are faced with important decisions regarding defense, such as positioning players, making defensive substitutions, and evaluating trade-offs between offensive and defensive abilities.\nAt the end of each season, MLB issues Gold Glove awards to the best defenders at each position, highlighting the importance of defense in the game.\n\nBefore the advent of high-resolution player tracking data, teams relied on simple defensive metrics such as fielding percentage, which calculates the percentage of plays a fielder successfully makes. \nThis depends on errors, which are charged when a fielder does not make a play that an average fielder would be expected to make.\nHowever, errors are prone to subjectivity, as they depend primarily on the official scorer's judgement.\nThese metrics also fail to capture the full scope of a player's defensive contributions, as they do not account for factors such as range, positioning, and the difficulty of plays made.\n\nStatisticians have tried to find ways to quantify the nuances of defense.\nIn 2003, Mitchel Lichtman introduced the Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR) metric, which attempted to evaluate defense by dividing the field into discrete zones and assigning run values to plays made or not made within those zones (@uzr_fangraphs).\nThis run-based approach allowed statisticians to understand the stakes of each defensive play.\nHowever, many criticisms of UZR exist, including the arbitrary nature of the zone definitions and the discretization of a continuous space.\n\n@jensen_2009 introduced the SAFE (Spatially Adjusted Fielding Evaluation) framework, which built upon UZR by using a hierarchical Bayesian model to evaluate defense as a continuous surface.\nThe SAFE framework uses estimates of player location, ball location, and ball velocity to model the probability of a fielder making a play on a batted ball, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of defensive performance.\nThe model combines the probability of a made play with the run consequences of that play to estimate the overall defensive contribution of a player in terms of runs saved or allowed.\nThe hierarchical Bayesian structure also allows for the sharing of information across players and positions, improving estimates for players with limited data.\nHowever, this model is limited by the accuracy and reliability of the underlying data used to estimate player and ball locations.\nThese data, provided by Baseball Info Solutions, used hand-annotated video footage to estimate ball location and velocity.\nEven then, the starting location of the fielder at a given position was estimated by the authors by using the average location of balls caught by that position.\n\nNotably, the results of @jensen_2009 showed that the autocorrelation of defensive metrics from year-to-year was quite low for infielders. \nThis shortcoming suggests that the original SAFE model performed poorly in evaluating infield defense, relative to outfield defense.\n\nSince the publication of the SAFE framework, MLB has introduced Statcast, a high-resolution player tracking system that uses a combination of radar and camera technology to track the movement of players and the ball in real-time (need to find a citation).\nStatcast provides a wealth of data that was previously unavailable, including precise measurements of player and ball locations, velocities, and trajectories.\nThis data has the potential to revolutionize defensive evaluation in baseball, allowing for more accurate and reliable estimates of defensive performance.\n\nThe goal of this paper is to modernize the original SAFE framework for infielders using three years of Statcast data (2023-2025).\nWe are interested in evaluating the number of runs saved or cost by infielders at each position (1B, 2B, SS, 3B) using updated data and methods.\nWe fit various hierarchical probit regression models similar to that of @jensen_2009 to estimate the probability of a ground ball resulting in a successful play by the fielder at each infield position (1B, 2B, SS, 3B).\nWe then convert these probability estimates into run values by estimating the run consequence of a given ground ball based on its location and velocity.\n\nFor each given player at each position and year, we estimate their overall defensive contribution in terms of runs saved or cost using the SAFE framework.\n\nFurther, we extend the original framework to include player-specific positioning data from Baseball Savant to improve our estimates of fielder starting locations.\nWe compare the results of these models to assess the impact of using high-resolution tracking data and updated positioning information on defensive evaluation.\nWe also evaluate the year-to-year reliability of our models to assess their effectiveness in capturing true defensive ability.\n\n## Data\n\nOur evaluation of infield defense is based on Statcast data from 2023-2025.\nAlthough Statcast data has been publicly available since 2015, we focus on the most recent three years because the infield \"shift\" was banned following the 2022 season.\nWe believe that narrowing the frame of our analysis to non-shifted seasons will yield more accurate estimates due to more consistent estimates for fielder locations.\nWe obtain data on batted balls through the `baseballr` package in R, which provides a convenient interface for scraping Statcast data from MLB's public API.\nThe result is an .Rds file for each year of interest where each observation corresponds to a single batted ball in play (BIP) event.\nFurther, as an extension of the original SAFE framework, we extract information on individual player positioning before each pitch by using the \"Fielder Positioning\" page on Baseball Savant (@savant_positioning). \nThe location for each infielder on a given play is not publicly available.\nHowever, Baseball Savant provides average positioning data for each player at each position based on all batted balls successfully fielded by that position.\nWe extract these data by downloading the relevant .csv files from the Baseball Savant website. \n\nFor each batted ball in play, we extract the relevant information needed to identify the fielder responsible for making a play, the location and velocity of the batted ball, and the outcome of the play.\n\nUsing these data, we derive the following factors for each batted ball:\n\n- **successful_play**: A binary indicator of whether the fielder successfully made a play on the batted ball (1 = successful play, 0 = unsuccessful play). For ground balls, this is defined as whether the fielder was able to field the ball and record at least one out. \n- **play_made_by**: The position (1B, 2B, SS, 3B) of the fielder who made the play on the batted ball (Other, if play is not successful or play is made by another position).\n- **location_x, location_y**: The $(x, y)$ coordinates of the batted ball when it reaches the fielder's location, measured in feet from home plate. The origin (0, 0) is at home plate, with the positive x-axis extending towards first base and the positive y-axis extending towards second base.\n- **spray_angle**: Derived from the $(x, y)$ coordinates, this angle represents the direction of the batted ball relative to home plate, measured in degrees. The first base foul line is 45 degrees, second base is 0 degrees, and the third base foul line is -45 degrees. \n- **launch_velocity**: The velocity at which a ball is hit off the bat, measured in miles per hour (mph).\n- **out_{pos}**: A binary indicator for each infielder position (1B, 2B, SS, 3B) indicating whether or not the player at that position recorded a successful play on the batted ball.\n\nThe resulting dataset contains 21 variables from 145,070 ground balls hit into fair territory from the 2023-2025 seasons. \n\n{{< embed exploratory.qmd#tbl-bip-summary >}}\n\n{{< embed exploratory.qmd#tbl-continuous-summary >}}\n\n@tbl-bip-summary shows summary statistics for ground balls hit into fair territory from the 2023-2025 seasons.\nThe proportion of ground balls resulting in outs and the number of outs recorded at each infield position are consistent across the three seasons.\n\n{{< embed exploratory.qmd#fig-fielder-positioning >}}\n\n[Might get moved to a Methods section] Following the process outlined in @jensen_2009, we derive the starting location of the fielder at each position by calculating the average $(x, y)$ coordinates of all batted balls successfully fielded by that position. \n@fig-fielder-positioning shows the calculated average fielder positioning for each infield position based on batted balls successfully fielded from the 2023-2025 seasons.\nNote that although our analysis is only focused on ground balls, we use all batted balls successfully fielded by each position to estimate the average starting location of the fielder at that position, as in the original SAFE framework.\nThis intuitively makes sense, as the starting position of the fielder should not depend on the type of batted ball hit.\n\n## Methods\n\nTo describe the modernization of the SAFE framework, we start with a technical overview of the original model from @jensen_2009.\nThe original SAFE model follows a two-step process.\nThe first step is to estimate the probability that a fielder makes a successful play on a ground ball using a hierarchical Bayesian probit regression model.\nThe second step is to apply run expectancy values to estimate the run consequences of each play, which are then combined with the probability estimates to derive an overall defensive metric for each player.\nIn other words, each player is assigned a positive or negative run value based on the expected number of runs they save or cost their team for a given play with respect to the difficulty of the play.\nOur goal is estimate SAFE values for each infielder in each year:\n\n$$\nSAFE_{i,p,y} = \\sum_{\\theta} \\sum_{V} PPA_{i,p,y}(\\theta, V) \\times \\Delta_{RE}(\\theta, V) \\times f(\\theta, V)\n$$\n\nwhere $PPA_{i,p,y}$ is the play probability added for player $i$ at position $p$ in year $y$, $\\Delta_{RE}$ is the change in run expectancy for a batted ball with spray angle $\\theta$ and velocity $V$, and $f(\\theta, V)$ is the density of batted balls hit with spray angle $\\theta$ and velocity $V$.\n\nWe first estimate the probability that a fielder makes a successful play on a batted ball for each combination of year and position.\nWithin a given position, we only consider plays in which the fielder at that position either made a successful play on the batted ball or nobody made a successful play on the batted ball.\nThis follows from the original SAFE framework, which only considers plays that the fielder at the given position had a chance to make.\nIt would be unfair to also consider plays in which another fielder made the play, as this would penalize the fielder at the given position for plays they had no chance to make.\nWe also only consider batted balls hit into fair territory and within 45 degrees of the fielder's position.\nThis limits our model to only plays that a player at that position would be eligible for. \nFurther, for each combination of year and position, we only consider players who had at least 10 plays at that position during that year. \n\nThis general probability model estimates the probability that a given play will be successful based on various covariates that describe the nature of the batted ball and the fielder's position.\nIn order to capture the defensive abilities of each fielder, we use a hierarchical structure, in which we fit random effects for each individual fielder at that position.\n\nThis process requires us to fit a model for each combination of position (1B, 2B, SS, 3B) and year (2023, 2024, 2025), resulting in a total of 12 models.\n@jensen_2009 uses a Bayesian hierarchical probit regression model to estimate the probability of a successful play on a batted ball.\nHowever, due to the large number of models to fit and the computational complexity of Bayesian methods, we use a frequentist hierarchical probit regression model for this analysis.\n\n\n### Modeling The Probability of a Successful Play on a Ground Ball\n\nA successful play on a ground ball is one in which the fielder records at least one out on the play. \nThen, we can define each batted ball $j$ as a Bernoulli trial with outcome $S_{ij} = 1$ if player $i$ made a successful play and $S_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.\nThen, we define:\n\n$$\nS_{ij} = \\text{Bernoulli}(p_{ij})\n$$\nwhere $p_{ij}$ is the probability that fielder $i$ makes a successful play on batted ball $j$.\n\nWe model this probability as a function of the velocity of the batted ball ($V_{ij}$), the angle ($\\theta_{ij}$) between the fielder's starting position and the location of the batted ball, and an indicator for whether the fielder must move left or right to make the play ($L_{ij} = 1$ for left, $L_{ij} = 0$ for right):\n\n$$\np_{ij} = \\Phi(\\beta_{i0} + \\beta_{i1} \\theta_{ij} + \\beta_{2} \\theta_{ij} L_{ij} + \\beta_{3} \\theta_{ij} V_{ij} + \\beta_{4} \\theta_{ij} V_{ij} L_{ij})\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF).\nIt's important to note that the coefficients $\\beta_{ik}$ for $k = 0, 1$ are player-specific, while the coefficients $\\beta_{k}$ for $k = 2, 3, 4$ are shared across all players at that position.\nOur model specification includes random intercept effects for each fielder, as well as random slope effects for the angle terms. \nWe allow each player to have a different baseline for fielding a given ground ball and a different slope for the angle terms.\nThis reflects our belief that different players may have different abilities to field balls hit at different angles.\nThe original Bayesian implementation of this model used player-specific coefficients for all terms, but we simplify this hierarchical structure to reduce computational complexity and improve model convergence.\n\n{{< embed probability_modeling.qmd#fig-random-intercepts >}}\n\n@fig-random-intercepts demonstrates individual player random intercepts for shortstops (SS) in the 2025 season. \nPlayers differ in their baseline abilities. \nHowever, the standard error of these estimates are large such that most of the players' random intercepts are not significantly positive or negative. \n\n\n### Measuring the Quality of a Play\n\nUnder this model, we calculate the estimated probability of a successful play for each batted ball in our dataset by using the fitted model for the relevant position and year.\nHowever, to evaluate the defensive contribution of each player, we need a baseline to compare these probabilities against. \nWe fit a separate model for each position and year, which uses the same covariates but does not include any player-specific effects. \nThen, for each batted ball, we can calculate the play probability added (PPA) as the difference between the estimated probability of a successful play with the player-specific effects and the estimated probability without the player-specific effects:\n\n$$\nPPA_{ij} = \\hat{p}_{ij}^{(player)} - \\hat{p}_{j}^{(avg)}\n$$\n\nThis is preferred to simply using the residual values from the player-specific model because it is desirable to compare the probability that a given player makes a successful play to the average probability that any player at that position would make a successful play on that batted ball.\n\n### Measuring the Run Consequences of Ground Balls\n\nConsider two different hard-hit ground balls that a third basemen receives, one to his left, and one to his right, each with equally difficult success probabilities.\nA ground ball hit to his side closest to the shortstop is most likely to result in a single.\nHowever, the ground ball hit closer to the left field foul line is more likely to result in a double.\nAlthough we would consider these plays equally difficult, the run consequences of each play are quite different.\nThen, it's important to weight each possible play by its run consequence to get a more accurate estimate of the overall defensive contribution of each player.\n\nEach play is associated with a change in expected runs for the defensive team, which we denote as $\\Delta_{RE}$.\nThis value is calculated as the difference in run expectancy before and after the play, where positive values represent runs saved by the defense and negative values represent runs cost by the defense as a result of the play.\nWe fit a generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate $\\Delta_{RE}$ of a ground ball $j$ based on its launch speed $V_j$ and spray angle $\\theta_j$:\n\n$$\n\\Delta_{RE, j} = f(V_j) + f(\\theta_j) + V_j\\theta_j + \\epsilon\n$$\n\nwhere $f$ represents a smooth function estimated by the GAM.\n\n\n### Estimating Player SAFE Values\n\nFinally, we calculate the SAFE value for each player $i$ at position $p$ in year $y$ by summing over a space of plausible values of $\\theta$ and $V$.\nFor each combination of $\\theta$ and $V$, we calculate the expected run value added/lost by player $i$ as:\n\n$$\nSAFE_{i,p,y} = \\sum_{\\theta} \\sum_{V} PPA_{i,p,y}(\\theta, V) \\times \\Delta_{RE}(\\theta, V) \\times f(\\theta, V)\n$$\n\nThis gives us an overall estimate of the number of runs saved or cost by player $i$ at position $p$ in year $y$ based on their defensive performance on ground balls.\n\n### Updated SAFE with Player-Specific Positioning\n\nThe original SAFE model attempts to estimate the starting location of each position by using the average location of all batted balls successfully fielded by that position.\nThis assumes that all players at a given position start from the same location, which is unlikely to be true in practice.\nIt also assumes a direct relationship between the location of successfully fielded balls and the starting position of the fielder, which may not hold if players have different ranges or positioning strategies.\nHowever, with the availability of player-specific positioning data from Baseball Savant, we can improve upon this estimate by using the average positioning data for each individual player at each position.\nThis allows us to capture the nuances of each player's defensive positioning, which may vary significantly from the average positioning for that position. \n\nFor this model extension, we follow the same model structure as before, but also incorporate the player-specific positioning data into the calculation of the distance, angle, and direction covariates.\nWe propose that a more accurate estimate of individual fielding starting position will give a better estimation of distance, angle, and direction for a given batted ball. \n\n\n## Results\n\n\n\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n:::{#refs}\n\n:::",
