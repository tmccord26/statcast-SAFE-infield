<abstract>
<p>High resolution tracking data has transformed player evaluation in
Major League Baseball (MLB), enabling high-level analysis of player
performance. While public analyses on batting and pitching have advanced
rapidly, defensive evaluation has been comparatively underdeveloped. The
SAFE (Spatially Adjusted Fielding Evaluation) framework, introduced by
Jensen, Shirley, and Wyner
(<xref alt="2009" rid="ref-jensen_2009" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>),
was the first effort in the public sphere to evaluate defense as a
continuous space. We revisit the SAFE framework using modern Statcast
data with an emphasis on infield defense, a notable struggle for prior
defensive metrics.</p>

  <title>1 Introduction</title>
  <p>The evaluation of batting and pitching in baseball has been at the
  forefront of sports analytics for decades, mostly due to their
  discrete nature and the availability of relevant, quantifiable data.
  It is relatively simple to measure the outcome of a plate appearance
  or a pitch, making it easier to develop metrics that accurately
  reflect player performance in these areas. In contrast, defensive
  evaluation has lagged behind due to the continuous, spatio-temporal
  nature of fielding.</p>
  <p>Still, Major League Baseball (MLB) organizations are faced with
  important decisions regarding defense, such as positioning players,
  making defensive substitutions, and evaluating trade-offs between
  offensive and defensive abilities. At the end of each season, MLB
  issues Gold Glove awards to the best defenders at each position,
  highlighting the importance of defense in the game.</p>
  <p>Before the advent of high-resolution player tracking data, teams
  relied on simple defensive metrics such as fielding percentage, which
  calculates the percentage of plays a fielder successfully makes, and
  errors, which count the number of plays that the player does not make
  that the average fielder would. However, these metrics fail to capture
  the full scope of a player’s defensive contributions, as they do not
  account for factors such as range, positioning, and the difficulty of
  plays made.</p>
  <p>Statisticians have tried to find ways to quantify the nuances of
  defense. In 2003, Mitchel Lichtman introduced the Ultimate Zone Rating
  (UZR) metric, which attempted to evaluate defense by dividing the
  field into discrete zones and assigning run values to plays made or
  not made within those zones. This was the first run-based attempt at
  quantifying defense over a continuous space. In 2009, Jensen, Shirley,
  and Wyner
  (<xref alt="2009" rid="ref-jensen_2009" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>)
  introduced the SAFE (Spatially Adjusted Fielding Evaluation)
  framework, which built upon UZR by using a hierarchical Bayesian model
  to evaluate defense as a continuous surface. The SAFE framework uses
  estimates of player location, ball location, and ball velocity to
  model the probability of a fielder making a play on a batted ball,
  allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of defensive performance. The
  hierarchical Bayesian structure also allows for the sharing of
  information across players and positions, improving estimates for
  players with limited data. However, this model is limited by the
  accuracy and reliability of the underlying data used to estimate
  player and ball locations. These data, provided by Baseball Info
  Solutions, used hand-annotated video footage to estimate ball location
  and velocity. Even then, the starting location of the fielder at a
  given position was estimated by the authors by using the average
  location of balls caught by that position.</p>
  <p>Notably, the results of Jensen, Shirley, and Wyner
  (<xref alt="2009" rid="ref-jensen_2009" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>)
  showed that the autocorrelation of defensive metrics from year to year
  was quite low, most notably for infielders. This shortcoming suggests
  that the original SAFE model performed poorly in evaluating infield
  defense, relative to outfield defense.</p>
  <p>Since the publication of the SAFE framework, MLB has introduced
  Statcast, a high-resolution player tracking system that uses a
  combination of radar and camera technology to track the movement of
  players and the ball in real-time. Statcast provides a wealth of data
  that was previously unavailable, including precise measurements of
  player and ball locations, velocities, and trajectories. This data has
  the potential to revolutionize defensive evaluation in baseball,
  allowing for more accurate and reliable estimates of defensive
  performance.</p>
  <p>In this paper, we modernize the original SAFE framework for
  infielders using Statcast data. We also pose an improved model, with
  additional covariates that were not available in the original SAFE
  framework.</p>
